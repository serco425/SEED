Defective Agricultural Seed Classification

Database link: http://bit.ly/ITUSEED

All the images in the link and the .m files; dort.m and texture.m, have to be in the same file path. 

Tests are done by commenting out the sections one by one in the dort.m for each sections start with CLASS1 and end with 25. Feel free to ask test analysis which can be seem a bit complex at first glance.

dort.m is the 2main' to be run. It calls the texture which is the novel texture analysis method proposed by MSc. Sercan AYGÜN namely Relational Bit Operator (RBO). Whomever use the code and/or database (allowed only for academic purposes) kindly expected to cite following paper:

S. Aygun and EO. Gunes, "Computer Vision Techniques for Automatic Determination of Yield Effective Bad Condition Storage Effects on Various Agricultural Seed Types," IEEE conf. Agro-Geoinformatics 2016, Tianjin, China, 18-20 July 2016, accepted (link will be provided after conference).
